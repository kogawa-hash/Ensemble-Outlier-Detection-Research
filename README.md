# Ensemble-Outlier-Detection-Research

Motivated by a growing gap between traditional outlier detection techniques used in political science and the recent advancements in data science, we analyze the performance of 33 novel outlier detection techniques on the problem domain of cross-country socioeconomic and political indicators. We systematically develop a labeled test set of 14 countries that are considered empirical outliers across decades of political science research with respect to a diverse set of variables. Based on a new benchmark, we find that Cook’s Distance, a standard technique for anomaly detection in the political science literature, is significantly outperformed by at least 90 combinations of other outlier detection algorithms and data normalization techniques; instead, the Cluster-Based Local Outlier Factor is the most effective technique for cross-country political datasets, outperforming Cook’s Distance by 87%. Finally, we develop a novel ensemble model, ACROSS, that maximizes the predictions of the best-performing methods from our benchmark, outperforming the recall of Cook’s Distance on our dataset by 251% while also improving the specificity-sensitive F1 metric.
