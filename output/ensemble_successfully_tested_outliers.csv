1,Tunisia,TUN,['is_mena'],['democracy'],7,"MENA countries have typically struggled with maintaining democratic institutions. For a long time, Tunisia has been an outlier with respect to consistent democratization, due to a ""large middle class"", being ""relatively well educated"", a society that is ""ethnically homogeneous"", and being ""closely linked economically to Europe"".",2011,2020,Bellin 2013,"Yale (comparative politics reading list), UC San Diego, UNC Chapel Hill, NYU, Ohio State, Northwestern, UT Austin",TUN 2011 - 2020
2,Costa Rica,CRI,['is_latam'],"['log_gdp_pc', 'fdi_pc']",6,"The economies of LATAM countries had been struggling throughout the 20th century.

3,Botswana,BWA,"['cpi', 'natural_resources']",['gdp_growth'],6,"The resource curse suggests that developing countries with abundant natural resources will likely have low economic growth, high levels of inequality, and lack democratic institutions. Botswana, and some other countries (article locked), have high economic growth and are democratic despite being developing and resource-rich. This may be due to the ""quality of regulation, such as the predictability of changes of regulations, and anticorruption policies, such as transparency and accountability in the public sector"".",1990,2006,Iimi 2007,"Yale (comparative politics reading list), UNC Chapel Hill, NYU, Ohio State, Northwestern, UT Austin",BWA 1990 - 2006

7,Brazil,BRA,['democracy'],['military_spending_of_gdp'],4,"Democracies spend less on military than autocracies, because autocrats need military power to maintain power & control dissent.

8,Mexico,MEX,['democracy'],['human_rights'],3,"Higher democratic development should lead to lower levels of human rights violations. Mexico is considered an outlier because its unique context of democratic transition, changes in electoral accountability, and the dynamics of fiscal transfers have led to different outcomes regarding human rights violations.",1948,2008,Brennan et al. 2022,"Harvard, MIT, UCLA",MEX 1948 - 2008
